def discrete_crossover(selected_population):
    """
    Perform discrete crossover on a selected population to generate offspring.
    In discrete crossover, each gene of the offspring is randomly selected from 
    one of the corresponding genes of the parents.
    Args:
        selected_population (list of lists): A list where each element is a list 
                                             representing an individual in the population. 
                                             The population size should be even.
    Returns:
        (list of lists): A list of offspring generated from the selected population. Each 
                       offspring is a combination of genes from two parents.
